# 🎮 Game Developer in Progress
Focused on building games and learning the fundamentals of game engines, physics, AI, and gameplay systems.

## 🧩 What I'm Working Toward
- Specializing in: Game Development
- Currently learning: Game engines, real-time rendering, gameplay logic
- Target skill: Full game pipeline from prototype to release

## 🔧 Skills (Current Foundation)
- Languages: C, C++, Python, Java (JDK), JavaScript
- Game Dev Targets: C++ for engine-level work, Python for prototypes
- Tools I'm moving toward: SDL2, OpenGL, Raylib, Godot, Unity/Unreal later once fundamentals are solid

## 🚀 Upcoming Projects (Planned Builds)
- 2D Pong Clone (C++ / SDL2)
- Snake Game with Clean Architecture (Python)
- Simple Platformer Prototype (Godot or Raylib)
- Basic Game Physics Sandbox
- AI Enemy Pathfinding Demo (C++)

> No flashy nonsense yet — I'm building fundamentals first.

## 📍 Next Steps for My Profile
- Add 3 starter repos showing actual progress
- Document setup instructions & gameplay gifs
- Show growth instead of perfection
